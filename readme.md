# Skyworld datapack infos
This datapack is focused on a floating island world (Sky World),
<br>it tweaks a lot of game mechanics to make you experince a nice world as your personal SKY!
<br>I focus this pack on the usage of create. If you want to use it different,
<br>please dont change it without my permission, but feel free to DM me for collab at GitHub.

## Why should i use it?
Because i try to balance your game experience to a point where not everything feels so repetive.
<br>Other sky islands offer you a shop or others ways to get stuff, here its more like a game,
<br>more RNG, more fun to explore.

## How is the gameplay intended?
Get your start island, find smth. nice with rtp, set a home (for basic items also).
<br>Start to gather materials as any normal sky island, but soon advance to create stuff and build
<br>factories on limitied space. Advance with contraptions or bridges to another island and conquer
<br>it and/or build on it to create your dream floating island world!
<br>Build *YOUR* personal DREAM SKY!

## Setup
You need to add this datapack while creating your world.
<br>Change the generator to *small sky islands* (The untranslated generator)
<br>Load the world and use `/reload`
<br>There are some admin options to change how the modules work, check the files for these infos.
